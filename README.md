# pseudo-theremin

This project explores the posibility of using
two HC-SR04 sensors with Arduino and Purr Data.

The theremin directory stores the arduino code theremin.ino
to configure the two sensors.

The pd directory contains the Purr Data patches for serveral applications.
Please note that unless you have the comport object install in your
Pure Data, the patches can only be opened by Purr Data.
